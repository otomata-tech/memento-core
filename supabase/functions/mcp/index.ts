const INSTRUCTIONS = `Memento — structured, sourced, multi-KB knowledge base.

This preamble IS your global doctrine (how Memento works); each KB ALSO carries
its own doctrine — mem_doctrine(workspace).

STRUCTURE: an **org** = a tenant (member directory: team, mission, client —
each also has their personal org); a **KB** (workspace) = a body of knowledge belonging
to ONE org, which CARRIES ITS SCOPE: visibility "org" (all org members, their
default org role), "private" (explicit accesses only) or "public" (readable/searchable
by everyone, the org keeps curation), plus per-KB individual **grants** (promote a member
to curator, invite an external party — mem_grant; a grant gives read or write, NEVER
governance). Your effective role on a KB = max(grant, org role if visibility=org|public);
curator+ = write, member = read. Governance (share, visibility, archive,
transfer) = admin of the owning ORG only. myRole null = a KB of your org that is manageable
but not readable (private without a grant).

GETTING STARTED (important — the server is stateless):
1. Orient yourself with THIS preamble (above + below), then call mem_workspaces:
   your map = orgs (→ your role → KB) + "shared" (KB shared with you outside your orgs) +
   "pinned" (public KB from other orgs that you pinned) + your default KB ("default").
2. To FIND information, prefer mem_search(workspace:"*") — it searches across your WHOLE
   universe (orgs + shared + pinned) — rather than walking the tree by hand.
3. Want to follow a public KB from another org? mem_pin_workspace({workspace}): it
   joins "pinned" and the search scope. mem_unpin_workspace to remove it.
4. Ambiguous? Set the default KB: mem_use_workspace({workspace}) (persisted, ≠ pin).
   Verbs taking "workspace" may omit it → default KB; an explicit "workspace" takes precedence.
5. Responses echo "workspace" AND "org": CHECK them, and tell the user where you
   read/write (especially before a write). When in doubt, ask.
6. Creating: mem_create_workspace requires "org" (pick it from mem_workspaces; mem_orgs is
   only for member detail).

doctrine-first PROTOCOL: on a targeted KB, mem_doctrine (preamble + tree + conventions)
BEFORE any drill. Target 2-3 sections, then mem_section / mem_document / mem_block, or
mem_search (hybrid: exact words + paraphrases). To READ/answer, never load
the whole base (target). To WRITE, it's the opposite — see LOAD BEFORE WRITING.

search vs enumeration ROUTING: mem_search is top-k, NEVER exhaustive. For
"all / which ones / how many / what's new since" → mem_list / mem_count
(deterministic, 100 % recall) and mem_revisions({since}) for the session delta.

WRITING: reserved for the org's admin/curator roles. Never mutate blindly —
propose via mem_stage_changes (→ human review), then mem_apply_ingestion.
Contradictions are never auto-applied.

LOAD BEFORE WRITING: on a reasonably sized KB, call mem_load(workspace)
BEFORE proposing a mem_stage_changes — you get all the content (+ a loadToken to
pass back to mem_stage_changes). It saves you from duplicates, lets you place the block in the
right spot, and gives you the blockId values to link. Proposing without loading is flagged (loadGate
field in the response).

LINKS (graph): when the loaded content makes you see a logical relation between two
blocks — especially CONTRADICTS (two facts oppose each other), SUPERSEDES (one obsoletes the other),
DEPENDS_ON (one presupposes the other) — set the link (op link_blocks in your
mem_stage_changes): the IDs are already in front of you. Don't spam RELATED (search
already covers topic adjacency) — aim for what a future reader MUST see. Explore
the existing graph with mem_neighborhood before modifying a heavily linked block.

FEEDBACK (near-mandatory): whenever Memento surprises you — unexpected error,
a search that misses content that should exist, a missing verb/capability,
an ambiguous parameter, a misleading description — report it via mem_log_usage BEFORE
working around it. One line is enough; it writes nothing to the KB and never blocks
your work. This is how the tool improves.`;
